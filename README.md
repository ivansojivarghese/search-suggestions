# Search Suggestions API

This project provides an API to fetch search suggestions using the Google Suggest API. The API handles requests from both browser and server environments, manages CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues, and parses the response data to return relevant search suggestions based on the provided term.

## [Technologies Used](#technologies-used-in-detail)

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework to handle API requests.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client to make requests.
- **CORS**: Middleware to manage cross-origin requests and security.
- **Google Suggest API**: API for fetching search suggestions from Google.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ivansojivarghese/search-suggestions.git
   cd search-suggestions
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Express server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

### `/api/suggestions`

- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Parameters**: 
  - `term` (required): The search term to get suggestions for.

#### Example Request:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/suggestions?term=trump
```

#### Example Response:

```json
[
  "trump news",
  "trump 2024",
  "trump rally",
  "trump impeachment",
  "trump speech"
]
```

### Error Handling

- If the `term` parameter is missing:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Search term is required"
  }
  ```

- If an error occurs while fetching suggestions (e.g., network error):
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Error fetching suggestions"
  }
  ```

## Features

- **CORS Handling**: The server uses the `cors` middleware to allow cross-origin requests from specified domains, such as `https://media-sphere.vercel.app`. You can modify the allowed origins based on your needs.
  
- **Browser and Server-Side Support**: The API distinguishes between browser and server environments and adjusts its request handling accordingly:
  - In the browser, it uses a JSONP adapter to bypass CORS restrictions.
  - On the server, it uses a regular Axios GET request.

- **Search Term Suggestions**: The API communicates with the Google Suggest API (`https://clients1.google.com/complete/search`) to retrieve relevant search suggestions for a given search term. It extracts and returns the suggestions in a clean format.

- **Error Handling**: The API includes robust error handling, ensuring meaningful responses are sent if the request is invalid or if there is an issue with fetching suggestions.

## Code Overview

### Server Setup

The server is built with **Express.js** and uses **Axios** to fetch search suggestions. CORS is handled using the `cors` middleware, which allows cross-origin requests from specific domains.

```js
import express from 'express';
import axios from 'axios';
import cors from 'cors';
import jsonpAdapter from 'axios-jsonp';

const app = express();

// CORS Configuration to allow a specific origin
app.use(cors({ origin: 'https://media-sphere.vercel.app' }));

// Endpoint to handle search suggestions
app.get('/api/suggestions', async (req, res) => {
  const { term } = req.query;

  if (!term) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Search term is required' });
  }

  const GOOGLE_AC_URL = 'https://clients1.google.com/complete/search';

  // Detect if we are in a browser environment
  const isBrowser = typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof document !== 'undefined';

  try {
    let response;

    // If in a browser, use jsonpAdapter for handling CORS
    if (isBrowser) {
      response = await axios({
        url: GOOGLE_AC_URL,
        adapter: jsonpAdapter,
        params: { client: 'youtube', hl: 'en', ds: 'yt', q: term },
      });
    } else {
      // Server-side request
      response = await axios.get(GOOGLE_AC_URL, {
        params: { client: 'youtube', hl: 'en', ds: 'yt', q: term },
      });
    }

    // Parse the response and extract suggestions
    const rawData = response.data;
    const jsonData = rawData.substring(rawData.indexOf('(') + 1, rawData.lastIndexOf(')'));
    const parsedData = JSON.parse(jsonData);

    if (Array.isArray(parsedData[1])) {
      const suggestions = parsedData[1].map(item => item[0]);
      return res.status(200).json(suggestions);
    } else {
      return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Invalid response structure from Google Suggest API' });
    }

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching suggestions:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error fetching suggestions' });
  }
});

// Start the server on port 3000
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

## Deployment

To deploy this API to platforms like **Vercel** or **Heroku**, follow their respective guides for deploying Node.js applications.

For **Vercel**:
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
2. Deploy with: `vercel deploy`

For **Heroku**:
1. Create a Heroku app: `heroku create`
2. Push the code: `git push heroku main`

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to create a simple API to fetch search suggestions using Google Suggest and handle CORS issues. It also handles both client-side and server-side environments, providing a smooth experience for various platforms.

## [Technologies Used (in detail)](#technologies-used-in-detail)

Hereâ€™s a summary of the techniques and technologies you worked with:

1. Express.js and API Setup
Express.js: You created an Express server to handle HTTP requests.

API Route: Defined a GET endpoint (/api/suggestions) to handle search term requests and fetch search suggestions.

2. CORS Handling
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): You configured CORS in the Express server to allow specific origins (https://media-sphere.vercel.app) to make requests to the server, preventing CORS issues when requesting resources from different origins.

3. Axios for HTTP Requests
Axios: Used Axios to send HTTP requests to the Google Suggest API endpoint (https://clients1.google.com/complete/search) and handle both server-side and client-side requests.

JSONP Adapter: Incorporated a custom JSONP adapter for the client-side requests to handle cross-origin requests in the browser, a solution for when CORS is restricted.

4. Google Autocomplete API (Google AC URL)
You utilized the Google Suggest API to fetch search suggestions based on a given search term. This data is used to return relevant suggestions for a search query.

5. Error Handling
Error Handling in API Requests: Incorporated error handling using try-catch to catch potential issues with the API request (e.g., invalid response, network errors).

Response Structure Validation: Added checks to ensure the structure of the response is valid and logs errors if the expected data format is not received.

6. Environment Detection
Browser vs Server Detection: Used a check (typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof document !== 'undefined') to detect if the code is running in a browser or server environment, allowing different logic for handling requests based on the environment.

7. Response Parsing
Handling JSONP Responses: For browser-side requests, you used a custom jsonpAdapter to handle the Google Suggest JSONP response format.

String Manipulation: In the server-side code, you extracted the JSON part from a wrapped JavaScript function using string manipulation (substring), and then parsed the JSON response.

8. Running the Code in a Serverless Environment
Serverless Deployments: Since the environment you're working in seems to be serverless (like Vercel or AWS Lambda), the structure of the app and how it was deployed is important. Express was integrated with serverless deployment, which helped manage the CORS policy and handle HTTP requests effectively.
